# SoWhat (Kya Boyein) Mobile Application :iphone:

Crop and Fertilizer Prediction Application

## Overview :bulb:

The name of the SoWhat app suggests a question: "Sow What?" which is prevalent among farmers regarding what to sow on a particular land. This app aims to act as an answer to this long-standing question. As mentioned before, the app accurately predicts which crop and fertilizer are suitable to be grown in the particular soil. This application utilizes Machine Learning to make predictions and integrates the ML model into a mobile app using Flutter, TensorFlow, and TensorFlow Lite. The app aims to ease the decision-making process for farmers.

## Inspiration :seedling:

Farmers living in different areas face varying climates, landscapes, microorganisms, plants, and animals, so they must adapt their growing practices to local conditions. Managing the decision-making processes of farming has always been complex due to many different limiting factors that aren’t within a farmer’s control. Thus, if we can contribute even a little to minimize their problems, it would be overwhelming.

## What Does the Application Do? :gear:

This app takes input of Nitrogen content, Phosphorus content, Potassium content, pH value of soil, Humidity, Rainfall, and average Temperature. Devices (YUVs kit for pH + humidity and npk kit for measuring N, P, K content of soil) are available in the market, which are not expensive at all. So, it's like a one-time investment for a farmer, and it predicts the suitable crop that can be grown in that soil. Also, it takes soil properties and crop properties into account and predicts which fertilizer is best for that particular crop.

### Technologies Used :computer:

- Decision Forest ML model with 99% accuracy
- Python, Numpy, Pandas
- Flutter
- Dart
- TensorFlow
- TensorFlow Lite

## Features of SoWhat App :rocket:

- Decision-making for farmers made easier using AI.
- Helps new farmers in selecting crops and fertilizers.
- Promotes sustainable agriculture.
- Predicts suitable crops for an area.
- Minimizes inefficient farming practices.
- Encourages appropriate and right use of resources.
- Saves farmers' time.

## Future Scope :telescope:

This app can be enhanced with the inclusion of more datasets to incorporate data of a greater variety of crops. This will result in the expansion of the prediction area and can be helpful for more and more farmers. Additionally, we can include video guidance on sustainable practices by experts for better understanding by farmers.

## Instructions to Use App :scroll:

1. On the homepage of the app, you'll see three options: "Go to crop prediction," "Go to fertilizer prediction," and "Change language."
2. Click on the first option if you want to predict the crop.
   - Enter all the input values appropriately.
   - Click on the "Predict" button to get the result.
3. Click on the second option if you want to predict the fertilizer.
   - Enter all the input values appropriately.
   - Click on the "Predict" button to get the result.
